I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en), studying robustness in natural language processing and machine learning at [Conversational AI and Social Analytics (CAISA)](https://caisa-lab.github.io/) Lab led by [Prof. Lucie Flek](https://caisa-lab.github.io/members/lucie-flek.html).
        
I did my PhD at the [University of Parma](https://www.unipr.it/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Andrea Prati](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PJAxU3QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [IMP Lab](https://implab.ce.unipr.it/), where I did research on making language models more robust using adversarial learning and data augmentation techniques.
